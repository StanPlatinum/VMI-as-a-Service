.SH "NAME"
XL \- Xen management tool, based on LibXenlight
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBxl\fR \fIsubcommand\fR [\fIargs\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBxl\fR program is the new tool for managing Xen guest
domains. The program can be used to create, pause, and shutdown
domains. It can also be used to list current domains, enable or pin
VCPUs, and attach or detach virtual block devices.
.PP
The basic structure of every \fBxl\fR command is almost always:
.Sp
.RS 2
\&\fBxl\fR \fIsubcommand\fR [\fI\s-1OPTIONS\s0\fR] \fIdomain-id\fR
.RE
.PP
Where \fIsubcommand\fR is one of the subcommands listed below, \fIdomain-id\fR
is the numeric domain id, or the domain name (which will be internally
translated to domain id), and \fI\s-1OPTIONS\s0\fR are subcommand specific
options.  There are a few exceptions to this rule in the cases where
the subcommand in question acts on all domains, the entire machine,
or directly on the Xen hypervisor.  Those exceptions will be clear for
each of those subcommands.
.SH "NOTES"
.IX Header "NOTES"
.IP "start the script \fB/etc/init.d/xencommons\fR at boot time" 4
.IX Item "start the script /etc/init.d/xencommons at boot time"
Most \fBxl\fR operations rely upon \fBxenstored\fR and \fBxenconsoled\fR: make
sure you start the script \fB/etc/init.d/xencommons\fR at boot time to
initialize all the daemons needed by \fBxl\fR.
.IP "setup a \fBxenbr0\fR bridge in dom0" 4
.IX Item "setup a xenbr0 bridge in dom0"
In the most common network configuration, you need to setup a bridge in dom0
named \fBxenbr0\fR in order to have a working network in the guest domains.
Please refer to the documentation of your Linux distribution to know how to
setup the bridge.
.IP "\fBautoballoon\fR" 4
.IX Item "autoballoon"
If you specify the amount of memory dom0 has, passing \fBdom0_mem\fR to
Xen, it is highly recommended to disable \fBautoballoon\fR. Edit
\&\fB/etc/xen/xl.conf\fR and set it to 0.
.IP "run xl as \fBroot\fR" 4
.IX Item "run xl as root"
Most \fBxl\fR commands require root privileges to run due to the
communications channels used to talk to the hypervisor.  Running as
non root will return an error.
.SH "GLOBAL OPTIONS"
.IX Header "GLOBAL OPTIONS"
Some global options are always available:
.IP "\fB\-v\fR" 4
.IX Item "-v"
Verbose.
.IP "\fB\-N\fR" 4
.IX Item "-N"
Dry run: do not actually execute the command.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f"
Force execution: xl will refuse to run some commands if it detects that xend is
also running, this option will force the execution of those commands, even
though it is unsafe.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR" 4
.IX Item "-t"
Always use carriage-return-based overwriting for printing progress
messages without scrolling the screen.  Without \-t, this is done only
if stderr is a tty.
.SH "DOMAIN SUBCOMMANDS"
.IX Header "DOMAIN SUBCOMMANDS"
The following subcommands manipulate domains directly.  As stated
previously, most commands take \fIdomain-id\fR as the first parameter.
.IP "\fBbutton-press\fR \fIdomain-id\fR \fIbutton\fR" 4
.IX Item "button-press domain-id button"
\&\fIThis command is deprecated. Please use \f(CI\*(C`xl trigger\*(C'\fI in preference\fR
.Sp
Indicate an \s-1ACPI\s0 button press to the domain. \fIbutton\fR is may be 'power' or
\&'sleep'. This command is only available for \s-1HVM\s0 domains.
.IP "\fBcreate\fR [\fIconfigfile\fR] [\fI\s-1OPTIONS\s0\fR]" 4
.IX Item "create [configfile] [OPTIONS]"
The create subcommand takes a config file as first argument: see
xl.cfg for full details of that file format and possible options.
If \fIconfigfile\fR is missing \fB\s-1XL\s0\fR creates the domain starting from the
default value for every option.
.Sp
\&\fIconfigfile\fR has to be an absolute path to a file.
.Sp
Create will return \fBas soon\fR as the domain is started.  This \fBdoes
not\fR mean the guest \s-1OS\s0 in the domain has actually booted, or is
available for input.
.Sp
If the \fI\-F\fR option is specified, create will start the domain and not
return until its death.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1OPTIONS\s0\fR
.RS 4
.IP "\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR" 4

.IP "\fB\-p\fR" 4
.IX Item "-p"
Leave the domain paused after it is created.
.IP "\fB\-F\fR" 4
.IX Item "-F"
Run in foreground until death of the domain.
.IP "\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-vncviewer\fR" 4
.IX Item "-V, --vncviewer"
Attach to domain's \s-1VNC\s0 server, forking a vncviewer process.
.IP "\fB\-A\fR, \fB\-\-vncviewer\-autopass\fR" 4
.IX Item "-A, --vncviewer-autopass"
Pass \s-1VNC\s0 password to vncviewer via stdin.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c"
Attach console to the domain as soon as it has started.  This is
useful for determining issues with crashing domains and just as a
general convenience since you often want to watch the
domain boot.
.IP "\fBkey=value\fR" 4
.IX Item "key=value"
It is possible to pass \fIkey=value\fR pairs on the command line to provide
options as if they were written in the configuration file; these override
whatever is in the \fIconfigfile\fR.
.Sp
\&\s-1NB:\s0 Many config options require characters such as quotes or brackets
which are interpreted by the shell (and often discarded) before being
passed to xl, resulting in xl being unable to parse the value
correctly.  A simple work-around is to put all extra options within a
single set of quotes, separated by semicolons.  (See below for an example.)

.IX Item "config-update domid [configfile] [OPTIONS]"
Update the saved configuration for a running domain. This has no
immediate effect but will be applied when the guest is next
restarted. This command is useful to ensure that runtime modifications
made to the guest will be preserved when the guest is restarted.
.Sp
Since Xen 4.5 xl has improved capabilities to handle dynamic domain
configuration changes and will preserve any changes made a runtime
when necessary. Therefore it should not normally be necessary to use
this command any more.

It is possible to pass \fIkey=value\fR pairs on the command line to

.IP "\fBdestroy\fR [\fI\s-1OPTIONS\s0\fR] \fIdomain-id\fR" 4
.IX Item "destroy [OPTIONS] domain-id"
Immediately terminate the domain \fIdomain-id\fR.  This doesn't give the
domain \s-1OS\s0 any chance to react, and is the equivalent of ripping the
power cord out on a physical machine.  In most cases you will want to
use the \fBshutdown\fR command instead.

Name is the name of the domain.  \s-1ID\s0 the numeric domain id.  Mem is the
desired amount of memory to allocate to the domain (although it may
not be the currently allocated amount).  VCPUs is the number of
virtual CPUs allocated to the domain.  State is the run state (see
below).  Time is the total run time of the domain as accounted for by
Xen.

The domain is currently running on a \s-1CPU.\s0
.IP "\fBb \- blocked\fR" 4
.IX Item "b - blocked"
The domain is blocked, and not running or runnable.  This can be caused
because the domain is waiting on \s-1IO \s0(a traditional wait state) or has
gone to sleep because there was nothing else for it to do.
.IP "\fBp \- paused\fR" 4
.IX Item "p - paused"
The domain has been paused, usually occurring through the administrator
running \fBxl pause\fR.  When in a paused state the domain will still
consume allocated resources like memory, but will not be eligible for
scheduling by the Xen hypervisor.

The domain has crashed, which is always a violent ending.  Usually
this state can only occur if the domain has been configured not to

The Time column is deceptive.  Virtual \s-1IO \s0(network and block devices)
used by domains requires coordination by Domain0, which means that
Domain0 is actually charged for much of the time that a DomainU is
doing \s-1IO. \s0 Use of this time value to determine relative utilizations
by domains is thus very suspect, as a high \s-1IO\s0 workload may show as
less utilized than a high \s-1CPU\s0 workload.  Consider yourself warned.

Because this operation requires cooperation from the domain operating
system, there is no guarantee that it will succeed.  This command will
definitely not work unless the domain has the required paravirt

Hard affinity can be used to restrict this, by ensuring certain VCPUs
