.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
To create a \s-1VM \s0(a domain in Xen terminology, sometimes called a guest)
with xl requires the provision of a domain config file.  Typically
these live in `/etc/xen/DOMAIN.cfg` where \s-1DOMAIN\s0 is the name of the
domain.
.SH "SYNTAX"
.IX Header "SYNTAX"
A domain config file consists of a series of \f(CW\*(C`KEY=VALUE\*(C'\fR pairs.
.PP
Some \f(CW\*(C`KEY\*(C'\fRs are mandatory, others are general options which apply to
any guest type while others relate only to specific guest types
(e.g. \s-1PV\s0 or \s-1HVM\s0 guests).
.PP
A value \f(CW\*(C`VALUE\*(C'\fR is one of:
.ie n .IP "\fB""\s-1STRING""\s0\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fB``\s-1STRING''\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "STRING"
A string, surrounded by either single or double quotes.
.IP "\fB\s-1NUMBER\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "NUMBER"
A number, in either decimal, octal (using a \f(CW0\fR prefix) or
hexadecimal (using an \f(CW\*(C`0x\*(C'\fR prefix).
.IP "\fB\s-1BOOLEAN\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "BOOLEAN"
A \f(CW\*(C`NUMBER\*(C'\fR interpreted as \f(CW\*(C`False\*(C'\fR (\f(CW0\fR) or \f(CW\*(C`True\*(C'\fR (any other
value).
.IP "\fB[ \s-1VALUE, VALUE, ... \s0]\fR" 4
.IX Item "[ VALUE, VALUE, ... ]"
A list of \f(CW\*(C`VALUES\*(C'\fR of the above types. Lists can be heterogeneous and
nested.
.PP
The semantics of each \f(CW\*(C`KEY\*(C'\fR defines which form of \f(CW\*(C`VALUE\*(C'\fR is required.

.ie n .IP "\fBname=""\s-1NAME""\s0\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fBname=``\s-1NAME''\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "name=NAME"
Specifies the name of the domain.  Names of domains existing on a
single host must be unique.
.SS "Selecting Guest Type"
.IX Subsection "Selecting Guest Type"
.ie n .IP "\fBbuilder=""generic""\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fBbuilder=``generic''\fR" 4

.ie n .IP "\fBbuilder=""hvm""\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fBbuilder=``hvm''\fR" 4
.IX Item "builder=hvm"
Specifies that this is to be an \s-1HVM\s0 domain.  That is, a fully
virtualised computer with emulated \s-1BIOS,\s0 disk and network peripherals,
etc.  The default is a \s-1PV\s0 domain, suitable for hosting Xen-aware guest
operating systems.
.SS "General Options"
.IX Subsection "General Options"
The following options apply to guests of any type.
.PP
\fI\s-1CPU\s0 Allocation\fR
.IX Subsection "CPU Allocation"
.ie n .IP "\fBpool=""\s-1CPUPOOLNAME""\s0\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fBpool=``\s-1CPUPOOLNAME''\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "pool=CPUPOOLNAME"
Put the guest's vcpus into the named cpu pool.
.IP "\fBvcpus=N\fR" 4
.IX Item "vcpus=N"
Start the guest with N vcpus initially online.
.IP "\fBmaxvcpus=M\fR" 4
.IX Item "maxvcpus=M"
Allow the guest to bring up a maximum of M vcpus. At start of day if
`vcpus=N` is less than `maxvcpus=M` then the first `N` vcpus will be
created online and the remainder will be offline.
.ie n .IP "\fBcpus=""\s-1CPU\-LIST""\s0\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fBcpus=``\s-1CPU\-LIST''\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "cpus=CPU-LIST"
List of which cpus the guest is allowed to use. Default is no pinning at
all (more on this below). A \f(CW\*(C`CPU\-LIST\*(C'\fR may be specified as follows:
.RS 4
.ie n .IP """all""" 4
.el .IP "``all''" 4
.IX Item "all"
To allow all the vcpus of the guest to run on all the cpus on the host.
.ie n .IP """0\-3,5,^1""" 4
.el .IP "``0\-3,5,^1''" 4
.IX Item "0-3,5,^1"
To allow all the vcpus of the guest to run on cpus 0,2,3,5. Combining
this with \*(L"all\*(R" is possible, meaning \*(L"all,^7\*(R" results in all the vcpus
of the guest running on all the cpus on the host except cpu 7.
.ie n .IP """nodes:0\-3,node:^2""" 4
.el .IP "``nodes:0\-3,node:^2''" 4
.IX Item "nodes:0-3,node:^2"
To allow all the vcpus of the guest to run on the cpus from \s-1NUMA\s0 nodes
0,1,3 of the host. So, if cpus 0\-3 belongs to node 0, cpus 4\-7 belongs
to node 1 and cpus 8\-11 to node 3, the above would mean all the vcpus
of the guest will run on cpus 0\-3,8\-11.
.Sp
Combining this notation with the one above is possible. For instance,
\&\*(L"1,node:2,^6\*(R", means all the vcpus of the guest will run on cpu 1 and
on all the cpus of \s-1NUMA\s0 node 2, but not on cpu 6. Following the same
example as above, that would be cpus 1,4,5,7.
.Sp
Combining this with \*(L"all\*(R" is also possible, meaning \*(L"all,^nodes:1\*(R"
results in all the vcpus of the guest running on all the cpus on the
host, except for the cpus belonging to the host \s-1NUMA\s0 node 1.
.ie n .IP "[""2"", ""3\-8,^5""]" 4
.el .IP "[``2'', ``3\-8,^5'']" 4
.IX Item "[2, 3-8,^5]"
To ask for specific vcpu mapping. That means (in this example), vcpu 0
of the guest will run on cpu 2 of the host and vcpu 1 of the guest will
run on cpus 3,4,6,7,8 of the host.
.Sp
More complex notation can be also used, exactly as described above. So
\&\*(L"all,^5\-8\*(R", or just \*(L"all\*(R", or \*(L"node:0,node:2,^9\-11,18\-20\*(R" are all legal,
for each element of the list.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
If this option is not specified, no vcpu to cpu pinning is established,
and the vcpus of the guest can run on all the cpus of the host. If this
option is specified, the intersection of the vcpu pinning mask, provided
here, and the soft affinity mask, provided via \fBcpus\e_soft=\fR (if any),
is utilized to compute the domain node-affinity, for driving memory
allocations.
.RE
.ie n .IP "\fBcpus_soft=""\s-1CPU\-LIST""\s0\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fBcpus_soft=``\s-1CPU\-LIST''\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "cpus_soft=CPU-LIST"
Exactly as \fBcpus=\fR, but specifies soft affinity, rather than pinning
(hard affinity). When using the credit scheduler, this means what cpus
the vcpus of the domain prefer.
.Sp
A \f(CW\*(C`CPU\-LIST\*(C'\fR is specified exactly as above, for \fBcpus=\fR.
.Sp
If this option is not specified, the vcpus of the guest will not have
any preference regarding on what cpu to run. If this option is specified,
the intersection of the soft affinity mask, provided here, and the vcpu
pinning, provided via \fBcpus=\fR (if any), is utilized to compute the
domain node-affinity, for driving memory allocations.
.Sp
If this option is not specified (and \fBcpus=\fR is not specified either),
libxl automatically tries to place the guest on the least possible
number of nodes. A heuristic approach is used for choosing the best
node (or set of nodes), with the goal of maximizing performance for
the guest and, at the same time, achieving efficient utilization of
host cpus and memory. In that case, the soft affinity of all the vcpus
of the domain will be set to the pcpus belonging to the \s-1NUMA\s0 nodes
chosen during placement.

\fI\s-1CPU\s0 Scheduling\fR
.IX Subsection "CPU Scheduling"
.IP "\fBcpu_weight=WEIGHT\fR" 4
.IX Item "cpu_weight=WEIGHT"
A domain with a weight of 512 will get twice as much \s-1CPU\s0 as a domain
with a weight of 256 on a contended host.
Legal weights range from 1 to 65535 and the default is 256.
Honoured by the credit and credit2 schedulers.
.IP "\fBcap=N\fR" 4
.IX Item "cap=N"
The cap optionally fixes the maximum amount of \s-1CPU\s0 a domain will be
able to consume, even if the host system has idle \s-1CPU\s0 cycles.
The cap is expressed in percentage of one physical \s-1CPU:
100\s0 is 1 physical \s-1CPU, 50\s0 is half a \s-1CPU, 400\s0 is 4 CPUs, etc.
The default, 0, means there is no upper cap.
Honoured by the credit and credit2 schedulers.
.Sp
\&\s-1NB:\s0 Many systems have features that will scale down the computing
power of a cpu that is not 100% utilized.  This can be in the
operating system, but can also sometimes be below the operating system
in the \s-1BIOS. \s0 If you set a cap such that individual cores are running
at less than 100%, this may have an impact on the performance of your
workload over and above the impact of the cap. For example, if your
processor runs at 2GHz, and you cap a vm at 50%, the power management
system may also reduce the clock speed to 1GHz; the effect will be
that your \s-1VM\s0 gets 25% of the available power (50% of 1GHz) rather than
50% (50% of 2GHz).  If you are not getting the performance you expect,
look at performance and cpufreq options in your operating system and
your \s-1BIOS.\s0
.PP
\fIMemory Allocation\fR
.IX Subsection "Memory Allocation"
.IP "\fBmemory=MBYTES\fR" 4
.IX Item "memory=MBYTES"
Start the guest with \s-1MBYTES\s0 megabytes of \s-1RAM.\s0
.IP "\fBmaxmem=MBYTES\fR" 4
.IX Item "maxmem=MBYTES"
Specifies the maximum amount of memory a guest can ever see.
The value of \fBmaxmem=\fR must be equal or greater than \fBmemory=\fR.
.Sp
In combination with \fBmemory=\fR it will start the guest \*(L"pre-ballooned\*(R",
if the values of \fBmemory=\fR and \fBmaxmem=\fR differ.
A \*(L"pre-ballooned\*(R" \s-1HVM\s0 guest needs a balloon driver, without a balloon driver
it will crash.
.Sp
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 Because of the way ballooning works, the guest has to allocate
memory to keep track of maxmem pages, regardless of how much memory it
actually has available to it.  A guest with maxmem=262144 and
memory=8096 will report significantly less memory available for use
than a system with maxmem=8096 memory=8096 due to the memory overhead
of having to track the unused pages.

\fIGuest Virtual \s-1NUMA\s0 Configuration\fR
.IX Subsection "Guest Virtual NUMA Configuration"
.IP "\fBvnuma=[ \s-1VNODE_SPEC, VNODE_SPEC, ... \s0]\fR" 4
.IX Item "vnuma=[ VNODE_SPEC, VNODE_SPEC, ... ]"
Specify virtual \s-1NUMA\s0 configuration with positional arguments. The
nth \fB\s-1VNODE_SPEC\s0\fR in the list specifies the configuration of nth
virtual node.
.Sp
Note that virtual \s-1NUMA\s0 for \s-1PV\s0 guest is not yet supported, because
there is an issue with cpuid handling that affects \s-1PV\s0 virtual \s-1NUMA.\s0
Furthermore, guests with virtual \s-1NUMA\s0 cannot be saved or migrated
because the migration stream does not preserve node information.
.Sp
Each \fB\s-1VNODE_SPEC\s0\fR is a list, which has a form of
\&\*(L"[\s-1VNODE_CONFIG_OPTION,VNODE_CONFIG_OPTION, ... \s0]\*(R"  (without quotes).
.Sp
For example vnuma = [ [\*(L"pnode=0\*(R",\*(L"size=512\*(R",\*(L"vcpus=0\-4\*(R",\*(L"vdistances=10,20\*(R"] ]
means vnode 0 is mapped to pnode 0, has 512MB ram, has vcpus 0 to 4, the
distance to itself is 10 and the distance to vnode 1 is 20.
.Sp
Each \fB\s-1VNODE_CONFIG_OPTION\s0\fR is a quoted key=value pair. Supported
\&\fB\s-1VNODE_CONFIG_OPTION\s0\fRs are (they are all mandatory at the moment):
.RS 4
.IP "\fBpnode=NUMBER\fR" 4
.IX Item "pnode=NUMBER"
Specify which physical node this virtual node maps to.
.IP "\fBsize=MBYTES\fR" 4
.IX Item "size=MBYTES"
Specify the size of this virtual node. The sum of memory size of all
vnodes will become \fBmaxmem=\fR. If \fBmaxmem=\fR is specified separately,
a check is performed to make sure the sum of all vnode memory matches
\&\fBmaxmem=\fR.
.IP "\fBvcpus=CPU\-STRING\fR" 4
.IX Item "vcpus=CPU-STRING"
Specify which vcpus belong to this node. \fBCPU-STRING\fR is a string
separated by comma. You can specify range and single cpu. An example
is \*(L"vcpus=0\-5,8\*(R", which means you specify vcpu 0 to vcpu 5, and vcpu
8.
.IP "\fBvdistances=NUMBER, \s-1NUMBER, ... \s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "vdistances=NUMBER, NUMBER, ... "
Specify virtual distance from this node to all nodes (including
itself) with positional arguments. For example, \*(L"vdistance=10,20\*(R"
for vnode 0 means the distance from vnode 0 to vnode 0 is 10, from
vnode 0 to vnode 1 is 20. The number of arguments supplied must match
the total number of vnodes.

Normally you can use the values from \*(L"xl info \-n\*(R" or \*(L"numactl

Enabling gfx_passthru option also copies the physical graphics card
video \s-1BIOS\s0 to the guest memory, and executes the \s-1VBIOS\s0 in the guest

Most graphics adapters require vendor specific tweaks for properly
working graphics passthrough. See the XenVGAPassthroughTestedAdapters

.Sp
gfx_passthru is currently only supported with the qemu-xen-traditional
device-model. Upstream qemu-xen device-model currently does not have
support for gfx_passthru.
.Sp
Note that some graphics adapters (\s-1AMD/ATI\s0 cards, for example) do not
necessarily require gfx_passthru option, so you can use the normal Xen
\&\s-1PCI\s0 passthrough to assign the graphics card as a secondary graphics
card to the \s-1VM.\s0 The QEMU-emulated graphics card remains the primary

\&\fB\s-1IOMEM_START\s0\fR is a physical page number. \fB\s-1NUM_PAGES\s0\fR is the number of pages
beginning with \fB\s-1START_PAGE\s0\fR to allow access. \fB\s-1GFN\s0\fR specifies the guest frame
number where the mapping will start in the domU's address space. If \fB\s-1GFN\s0\fR is
not given, the mapping will be performed using \fB\s-1IOMEM_START\s0\fR as a start in the
domU's address space, therefore performing an 1:1 mapping as default.
All of these values must be given in hexadecimal.
.Sp
Note that the \s-1IOMMU\s0 won't be updated with the mappings specified with this

.IP "\fBe820_host=BOOLEAN\fR" 4
.IX Item "e820_host=BOOLEAN"
Selects whether to expose the host e820 (memory map) to the guest via
the virtual e820. When this option is false (0) the guest pseudo-physical
address space consists of a single contiguous \s-1RAM\s0 region. When this
option is specified the virtual e820 instead reflects the host e820
and contains the same \s-1PCI\s0 holes. The total amount of \s-1RAM\s0 represented
by the memory map is always the same, this option configures only how
it is laid out.
.Sp
Exposing the host e820 to the guest gives the guest kernel the
opportunity to set aside the required part of its pseudo-physical
address space in order to provide address space to map passedthrough
\&\s-1PCI\s0 devices. It is guest Operating System dependent whether this
option is required, specifically it is required when using a mainline
Linux (\*(L"pvops\*(R") kernel. This option defaults to true (1) if any \s-1PCI\s0
passthrough devices are configured and false (0) otherwise. If you do not
configure any passthrough devices at domain creation time but expect
to hotplug devices later then you should set this option. Conversely
if your particular guest kernel does not require this behaviour then
it is safe to allow this to be enabled but you may wish to disable it
anyway.

.IP "\fBhap=BOOLEAN\fR" 4
.IX Item "hap=BOOLEAN"
Turns \*(L"hardware assisted paging\*(R" (the use of the hardware nested page
table feature) on or off.  This feature is called \s-1EPT \s0(Extended Page
Tables) by Intel and \s-1NPT \s0(Nested Page Tables) or \s-1RVI \s0(Rapid
Virtualisation Indexing) by \s-1AMD. \s0 Affects \s-1HVM\s0 guests only.  If turned
off, Xen will run the guest in \*(L"shadow page table\*(R" mode where the
guest's page table updates and/or \s-1TLB\s0 flushes etc. will be emulated.
Use of \s-1HAP\s0 is the default when available.
.IP "\fBoos=BOOLEAN\fR" 4
.IX Item "oos=BOOLEAN"
Turns \*(L"out of sync pagetables\*(R" on or off.  When running in shadow page
table mode, the guest's page table updates may be deferred as
specified in the Intel/AMD architecture manuals.  However this may
expose unexpected bugs in the guest, or find bugs in Xen, so it is
possible to disable this feature.  Use of out of sync page tables,
when Xen thinks it appropriate, is the default.
.IP "\fBshadow_memory=MBYTES\fR" 4
.IX Item "shadow_memory=MBYTES"
Number of megabytes to set aside for shadowing guest pagetable pages
(effectively acting as a cache of translated pages) or to use for \s-1HAP\s0
state. By default this is 1MB per guest vcpu plus 8KB per \s-1MB\s0 of guest
\&\s-1RAM.\s0 You should not normally need to adjust this value. However if you
are not using hardware assisted paging (i.e. you are using shadow
mode) and your guest workload consists of a a very large number of
similar processes then increasing this value may improve performance.

Include information regarding \s-1APIC \s0(Advanced Programmable Interrupt
Controller) in the firmware/BIOS tables on a single processor
guest. This causes the \s-1MP \s0(multiprocessor) and \s-1PIR \s0(\s-1PCI\s0 Interrupt
Routing) tables to be exported by the virtual firmware. This option
has no effect on a guest with multiple virtual \s-1CPUS\s0 as they must
always include these tables. This option is enabled by default and you

Enables or disables hvm guest access to alternate\-p2m capability.
Alternate\-p2m allows a guest to manage multiple p2m guest physical

disabled by default and is available only to hvm domains.
You may want this option if you want to access\-control/isolate

The enlightenments should be harmless for other versions of Windows
(although they will not give any benefit) and the majority of other
non-Windows OSes.
However it is known that they are incompatible with some other Operating
Systems and in some circumstance can prevent Xen's own paravirtualisation
interfaces for \s-1HVM\s0 guests from being used.

The viridian option can be specified as a boolean. A value of true (1)

The following options control the features of the emulated graphics
device.  Many of these options behave similarly to the equivalent key
in the \fB\s-1VFB_SPEC_STRING\s0\fR for configuring virtual frame buffer devices
(see above).
.IP "\fBvideoram=MBYTES\fR" 4
.IX Item "videoram=MBYTES"
Sets the amount of \s-1RAM\s0 which the emulated video card will contain,
which in turn limits the resolutions and bit depths which will be
available.
.Sp
When using the qemu-xen-traditional device-model, the default as well as
minimum amount of video \s-1RAM\s0 for stdvga is 8 \s-1MB,\s0 which is sufficient for e.g.
1600x1200 at 32bpp. For the upstream qemu-xen device-model, the default and
minimum is 16 \s-1MB.\s0
.Sp
When using the emulated Cirrus graphics card (\fBvga=\*(L"cirrus\*(R"\fR) and the
qemu-xen-traditional device-model, the amount of video \s-1RAM\s0 is fixed at 4 \s-1MB,\s0
which is sufficient for 1024x768 at 32 bpp. For the upstream qemu-xen
device-model, the default and minimum is 8 \s-1MB.\s0
.Sp
For \fBqxl\fR vga, the default is both default and minimal 128MB.
If \fBvideoram\fR is set less than 128MB, an error will be triggered.
.IP "\fBstdvga=BOOLEAN\fR" 4
.IX Item "stdvga=BOOLEAN"
Select a standard \s-1VGA\s0 card with \s-1VBE \s0(\s-1VESA BIOS\s0 Extensions) as the
emulated graphics device. The default is false (0) which means to emulate
a Cirrus Logic \s-1GD5446 VGA\s0 card. If your guest supports \s-1VBE 2.0\s0 or
later (e.g. Windows \s-1XP\s0 onwards) then you should enable this.
stdvga supports more video ram and bigger resolutions than Cirrus.
This option is deprecated, use vga=\*(L"stdvga\*(R" instead.

Configure the keymap to use for the keyboard associated with this
display. If the input method does not easily support raw keycodes
(e.g. this is often the case when using \s-1VNC\s0) then this allows us to
correctly map the input keys into keycodes seen by the guest. The
specific values which are accepted are defined by the version of the
device-model which you are using. See \*(L"Keymaps\*(R" below or consult the
\&\fIqemu\fR\|(1) manpage. The default is \fBen-us\fR.

Adds \fB\s-1DEVICE\s0\fRs to the emulated \s-1USB\s0 bus. The \s-1USB\s0 bus must also be
enabled using \fBusb=1\fR. The most common use for this option is
\&\fBusbdevice=['tablet']\fR which adds pointer device using absolute
coordinates. Such devices function better than relative coordinate
devices (such as a standard mouse) since many methods of exporting
guest graphics (such as \s-1VNC\s0) work better in this mode. Note that this
is independent of the actual pointer device you are using on the
host/client side.
.Sp
Host devices can also be passed through in this way, by specifying
host:USBID, where \s-1USBID\s0 is of the form xxxx:yyyy.  The \s-1USBID\s0 can
typically be found by using lsusb or usb-devices.
.Sp
If you wish to use the \*(L"host:bus.addr\*(R" format, remove any leading '0' from the
bus and addr. For example, for the \s-1USB\s0 device on bus 008 dev 002, you should
write \*(L"host:8.2\*(R".
